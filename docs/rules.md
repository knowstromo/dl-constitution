# __League Rules__

## General

### League Size
The league size is 12 teams.

### Gameplay
The league will use Head-To-Head `Categories` scoring using the randomly generated Yahoo regular season schedule. 6 teams will be eligible for the playoffs based on their Head-To-Head record. Tiebreakers and standings will be determined by Yahoo.

### Platform 
The league uses Yahoo as its official platform. Any settings controlled by Yahoo, such as positional eligibility, stat accumulation, scoring adjustments, weekly schedules, injury designations, game postponements, supercede any rules outlined in this document.

### League Rules & Voting
Rule changes, settings changes or any other decision that would change gameplay will require an official league vote. Any change requires 9/12 approval votes.

Rule changes and voting is generally restricted to the `Winter Meeting`. However, the `Commissioner` may bring a special vote at any time if circumstances should require it.

### League Dues
A payment of `$200` will be due to the Commissioner by the conclusion of the `Winter Meeting`. 

Failure to pay league dues will prevent the deliquent team from keeping players into the following season. If this occurs, an emergency league meeting will determine how that team's current roster is managed.

### League Prizes / Punishments
* 1st place: $1600 and the Dangerous Lumber bat.
* 2nd Place: $400
* Regular Season Winner (Categories): $400
* The Winner of the Loser's Bracket aka `Sausage King`: A Sausage of High to Very High quality provided by the runner up of the Loser's Bracket.
* Last Place Punishment: The loser of the regular season must send a video apologizing to the league for their performance before the following Winter Meeting. Minimum 30 seconds.

### Collusion/Fairness
No one shall make a move to benefit another team, without trying to improve its own position. Collusion, quid pro quo and payments of any kind are prohibited. Do not take any action where its purpose would hinder fair play in the league.

### Wartime Notification
`The Montero Rule` League participants must inform the league 30 days before going to an active warzone

### Buying Jason's Wife A Porsche
The first person to make $700 million (or sign a deferred $700M contract) buys Jasonâ€™s wife a Porsche. This is not a cuck thing.

## The Draft

#### Draft Date
The draft date will be selected during that season's `Winter Meeting`. The draft date will be as close to Opening Day as possible, given member availability.
#### Draft Format
Live Snake Draft using Yahoo.
#### Draft Settings
1 minute pick time.
#### Draft Order Selection

##### Non-Playoff Teams
Teams that finished outside of the playoffs (7-12) in the previous season will have their draft selection order randomly selected using a custom WWE 2K22 6 Man Elimination Match PPV simulation. The `Selection Order` will be awarded in reverse order in which the contestants are eliminated. The simulation will broadcast live on Discord on a date between the `Keeper Deadline` and `Draft Order Selection`.

##### Playoff Teams
Teams that finished in the playoffs (1-6) will select their draft position in the following order based on their final standings position, including the playoffs:

| Final Standings      | Draft Order Selection       |
| :---------: | :----------------------------------: |
| `1`       | Pick 12  |
| `2`       | Pick 11 |
| `3`    | Pick 9 |
| `4`    | Pick 10 |
| `5`    | Pick 7 |
| `6`    | Pick 8 |

##### Order Selection Process
The draft order will be selected, in the order specified above, on the `Draft Order Selection` date, determined during the `Winter Meeting`. The date should be 2-3 weeks prior to the `Draft` Date.

The `Commissioner` will share the Google Sheet via `Discord`. That team will select their draft position as soon as possible and notify the next team that they are on the clock via `Discord`. 

##### Draft Order Finalization
Each team's draft position will be final upon confirming their selection in `Discord`. Once the selection process is complete, the `Commissioner` will manually enter the draft order into Yahoo. The team that selected draft position `1` will be the first to draft in the first non-keeper round of the draft.

```
For example, even though the Yahoo draft order will be:

Round 1: 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

Round 2:
12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
...

If actual league draft begins at Round 10, the order will be reverse:

Round 10:
12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

The commissioner will adjust for this and ensure that the team that selected draft position 1 will draft first.
```

##### Draft Bugs/Errors
If a bug or an error occurs during the draft, the `Commissioner` will determine its characteristics and impact to make a judgement call. For high impact bugs and errors, a league vote will commence. As with any league vote, 9 votes will be required for any decision to pass.

## Scoring
The league scoring format is Head-To-Head Categories. Each of the 12 categories will be 1 point towards the matchup score. Each matchup score will have 12 total points allocated towards Wins, Losses and Ties (W-L-T).

### Categories
The league uses the following scoring categories:

| Hitting      | Pitching      |
| :---------: | :----------------------------------: |
| `Runs`       | `Wins`  |
| `Home Runs`       | `Strikeouts` |
| `RBI`    | `Net Holds + Saves` |
| `AVG`    | `ERA`* |
| `OPS`    | `WHIP`* |
| `Net SB`    | `Quality Starts` |

<sub>*Requires 30 Innings Pitched (IP) to qualify for the category.</sub>

### Playoff Tiebreaks
In the playoffs, if a matchup is tied, the higher seed will advance.

## Rosters
As with League Settings, many roster Settings are controlled by Yahoo. Unless Yahoo has allowed for customization, those settings will supercede any rules outlined in this section. 

### Team Size
Teams will have 23 active roster spots, 4 Injury `IL` positions and 2 `N/A` spots.

### Positions
```
Hitting: 10
C, 1B, 2B, 3B, SS, OF, OF, OF, Util, Util

Pitching: 8

```
### IL Spots
Each team will have 4 Injury `IL` positions. Eligibility will be determined by Yahoo.

### N/A Spots
Each team will have 2 `N/A` positions. Eligibility will be determined by Yahoo.

### Keepers
Managers retain the Keeper Rights to all Players on their roster at the end of the season, except for expiring/unrestricted Keepers. Beginning January 1 of each year, managers are allowed to trade any rostered Player to an opposing Manager for another Player or Draft compensation.

During the `Winter Meeting`, the `Keeper Declaration` date will be determined. The date will precede the `Draft Order Selection` date by at least 3 days.

At the `Keeper Declaration` date each team will select `9` eligible players to carry into the upcoming season. 

A player will be deemed ineligible to be kept if they have already been kept by that team `4` times.

Current keeper details can be found on the _Keepers_ section of this site.

### Positional Eligibility
Eligibility is determined by Yahoo, using the following criteria:
```
Batters need either 5 Games Started or 10 Games Played at a position to gain eligibility. 

Pitchers need 3 Starts to gain SP eligibility, 5 Relief Appearances to gain RP eligibility.
```

```
For example, any trade made using next season's 1-9 round draft picks will be ineligible.
```

Any trade including an ineligible draft pick will be Vetoed by the `Commissioner`.

#### Accidental Trades/Mistakes
A team must notify the `Commissioner` and their trade partner as soon as the accident/mistake occurs. The `Commissioner` will use their judgement to determine the outcome. If accidental trades or mistakes are identified immediately after trade acceptance, the `Commissioner` should Veto the trade.
